# JAVAProjects
Author: Niladri Das

This public repo will contain all JAVA assignments that are done in the OOP lab. Feel free to add code and contribute. Please refer to
standard contributing guidelines in that case.


If you're familiar with Git, then you should know your way around. Otherwise, feel free 
to copy the code present in the individual files.
**IMPORTANT**: Keep in mind that the package names for each file is unique to this repo.
As such, should you wish to run the code in your own environment/editor, be sure to change the package names.

Directory is structured as such:
<br>src>JAVAAssignments[Root directory]>Assignments
<br>These are the only folders you'll need. You can edit the other folders/files
present, but I encourage you to fork this repo in that case.

This repo will be updated with time.
